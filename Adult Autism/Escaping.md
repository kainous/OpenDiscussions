Firstly, thank you for reading up on this and continuing to understand.

The card you received, and/or the site you are reading attempts to simplify the understanding of what is happening in the moment.

# Why I Gave You This
I need to remove myself from the environment, not necessarily from you.

# "I'm Overstimulated"
The noises, the smells, the visuals, and/or frankly any and all things sensory have made me unable to continue. Continuing to stay in this environment may lead me to behave uncontrollably, and I'd like to avoid that embarrassment.

# I Enjoy Our Time Together
It is likely that you are receiving this explanation because I enjoy spending time with you, or enjoy one or more activities that we are engaging in. However, I do not process sensory stimuli, and stimuli in general, as easily as most people do. Every noise, every smell, every sight is interpreted as a demand, not unlike an unruly boss yelling numerous orders. I would like to focus on our enjoyment instead of the unruly boss.

# Affect on Me and Our Time Together
People with autism have different working levels of neurotransmitters that relate to excitement, startle response, and calm (Serotonin, Dopamine, and GABA). I won't enjoy my time with you under these circumstances. These effects can limit engagement in social situation for people of all ages, with autism.

# Joint Actions and Moving Forward
I would not have sent you here if I did not want to spend time with you. I recommend that we do the following:
* Provide me time to recover
* Coordinate with me a new experience together

Keep in mind that the next experience will go better in a session where focus is easier. Maybe you want to experience something with me that demands more stimuli, and so if you don't find it embarrassing, I can bring tools, such as noise cancellation headphones, sunglasses, or anything else that may help reduce the stimuli for me. 

Also, perhaps this was an uncommon occurrence or there were extinuating circumstances.
