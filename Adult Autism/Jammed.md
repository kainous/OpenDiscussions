Firstly, thank you for reading up on this and continuing to understand.

The card you received, and/or the site you are reading attempts to simplify the understanding of what is happening in the moment.

# "I'm Jammed"
Using the analogy of machine, such as a sewing machine threaded too fast, or a printer with paper threaded slightly off-center, or even traffic in a highway, my ability to form thoughts and words has become "stuck".

# Your Conversation is Important to Me
It is likely that you are receiving this explanation because I recognize the importance of what you are trying to express, and I recognize the importance of you, trying to express it. Your emotions indicate to me that it is important. In the process of trying to understand and work with you, I likely saw the importance, but moved too fast with my own thoughts, and my thoughts have created a jam.

# Affect on Me and the Conversation
I'd like us to agree that mutual conversation needs the both of us to continue, and I'm unable to do so right now. This is not a way to cop-out of the conversation, this is something that affects people with autism, even up through their adulthood, and can form a hard limit to engagement in social situations. Please recognize the similarities to overstimulation, since this is a social overstimation.

# Joint Actions and Moving Forward
I would not have sent you here if I did not want to work through things. I recommend that we do the following:
1. Provide me time to "unjam"
1. Coordinate a new planned time to discuss this again
1. Understand why and prepare to have this discussion more than once

If we need more than one discussion-session to fully address your concerns and communicate mine, it is not because I'm not listening or wanting to understand, it's because I want to get it right, and may need more patience in doing so.
