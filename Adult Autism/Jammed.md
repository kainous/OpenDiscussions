Firstly, thank you for reading up on this and continuing to understand. If you are reading this, please continue to read it to the end, so that there is no misunderstanding by stopping and focusing on any one statement.

The card you received, and/or the site you are reading attempts to simplify the understanding of what is happening in the moment.

# Why I Gave You This
Perhaps you were screaming or yelling at me, and I may or may not know and understood why, but I now find myself non-verbal in the moment, which will make both of us more frustrated if I'm perceived as either "not listening" or "unresponsive".

We together were less vocal, but the content of the conversation has veered into a direction in which has made me think hard about what you are saying, and I can no longer fully process the conversation in the moment.

Finally, I also may have given you this because the room and environment in which we are having the conversation is making it too difficult to continue with it.

# "I'm Jammed"
Using the analogy of machine, such as a sewing machine threaded too fast, or a printer with paper threaded slightly off-center, or even traffic in a highway, my ability to form thoughts and words has become "stuck".

# Your Conversation is Important to Me
It is likely that you are receiving this explanation because I recognize the importance of what you are trying to express, and I recognize the importance of you, trying to express it. Your emotions indicate to me that it is important. In the process of trying to understand and work with you, I likely saw the importance, but moved too fast with my own thoughts, and my thoughts have created a jam.

# Affect on Me and the Conversation
I'd like us to agree that mutual conversation needs the both of us to continue, and I'm unable to do so right now. This is not a way to cop-out of the conversation, this is something that affects people with autism, even up through their adulthood, and can form a hard limit to engagement in social situations. Please recognize the similarities to overstimulation, since this is a social overstimation.

# Joint Actions and Moving Forward
I would not have sent you here if I did not want to work through things. I recommend that we do the following:
1. Provide me time to "unjam"
1. Coordinate with me on a new planned time to discuss this again
1. Understand why and prepare to have this discussion more than once

If we need more than one discussion-session to fully address your concerns and communicate mine, it is not because I'm not listening or wanting to understand, it's because I want to get it right, and may need more patience in doing so.

Keep in mind that the content of the conversation may be difficult for me. I often have enough difficulty recognizing my own emotions, and therefore (some) emotional topics can be difficult to relate to and/or comprehend. This does not mean that I'm incapable of empathizing, but often that the full processing of what is happening to you, and relating that to my own experiences, may even happen after the conversation has ended.
